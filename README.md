# 2025 Coding Artifact

An educative and fun project that aims at solidifying understanding of Claude Desktop uses especially around [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io).
The project delves into efficient use of agent skills scripts. The project demonstrates how
to transfer data to Claude Desktop and how to create a determinstic JSX artifact. The project is also
a fun activity that you could apply with your team to brag about coding stats during the year. See example below:
